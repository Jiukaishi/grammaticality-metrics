<p>Each submission should be a zip file containing <em>answer.txt</em>, which contains one sentence of output per line, aligned to the original CoNLL 2014 test set.</p>
<p>The following metrics will be calculated on different reference sets:</p>
<ul>
<li>LT</li>
<li>GLEU</li>
<li>M2</li>
<li>Interpolated LT+GLEU and LT+M2, using lambda optimized by both Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Reference sets:</p>
<ul>
<li>NUCLE annotations</li>
<li>Expert and non-expert fluency and minimal edits</li>
</ul>
<p>The full scores can be optained by downloading the scoring output. To obtain scores using I-measure or other reference sets, please <a href="https://github.com/cnap/grammaticality-metrics" target="_blank">dowwnload the scorer</a>. We have excluded I-measure from the CodaLab site because it can take several minutes, in which time CodaLab may timeout.</p>
