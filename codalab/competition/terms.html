<p>This site was created to support uniform evaluation of grammatical error corrections and is not a true competition. Any information submitted to the "competition" is the property of the participant and will not be used by the organizers for any purposes.</p>
<p>Because the test set is entirely public, gamed submissions are possible, so the highest scores on the leaderboard may not be the true best results on this dataset.</p>
<h1>Visibility and Privacy</h1>
<p>Unless you submit your results to the leaderboard or post in a forum, your participation in this "competition" is hidden, except to the organizers. Submitting results to the leaderboard is optional. When a result is submitted to the leaderboard, any participant can view the system output.</p>
<p>If you wish for your system output to remain private, do not submit the results to the leaderboard.&nbsp;At this time, CodaLab does not provide support for participants to delete their submissions. If you wish for your submissions to be removed please contact the organizers. CodaLab is set up so that the organizers can view all submissions, but we pledge to not view or use any results that are not submitted to the leaderboard.</p>
